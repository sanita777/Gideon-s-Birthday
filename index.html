<h1>Happy 23rd birthday Gideon, chale!</h1>

<p><b>Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV):"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future."</b></p>
 
<div>Gratitude for the Friendship:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Happy Birthday, Gideon! On your special day, I want to express just how grateful I am for the friendship we’ve built. You've truly been a great friend to me, and I feel so blessed to have you in my life. I love the way you stay grounded and calm, always taking the time to share your thoughts and life experiences. It’s not every day that you meet someone so kind, thoughtful, and genuine. I’m thankful for the advice, the random trips, and just the simple moments we've shared together. You’re such a faithful and kind soul, and I admire that so much. You truly bring light to the lives of those around you, and I’m so lucky to have you as a friend. </li>
</ul>

<div> Our Miraculous Meeting</div>
<ul>
    <li> It's truly amazing how life works sometimes. I truly believe that it wasn’t a coincidence that we met. It's been such a blessing to have you here, especially as it's your first birthday in America! I know that God's blessings are on the way for you, and I believe He has so many surprises in store for you that you’ll be in awe. The bond we’ve built is special, and I know that as we continue to share thoughts, advice, and life lessons, we’ll both grow together. Your faithfulness and your willingness to be open about your life have made our friendship even more meaningful, and I couldn’t be more thankful.</li>
</ul>

<div>Stepping Into a New Chapter: Bold and Courageous</div>
<ul>
    <li>Gideon, you’re about to step into another remarkable chapter of your life. As you prepare to serve the nation, I want you to know how proud I am of you. I see so much boldness and courage in you, and I know you’re ready to soar to new heights. You’ve already made your parents proud, and I’m confident that your journey will only amplify the impact you have on them. You’re a good son, and I’m sure you’ll continue to be a shining example of strength and integrity. Don’t ever feel lonely on this path—you can always reach out to us, and you know that Mrs. Donna and I are always here for you, no matter what. You are chosen, and I believe you will fly high and accomplish great things. Keep your faith strong, and know that you are never alone.</li>

<div>My first webpage/ a digital gift</div>
<ul>
    <li>As a small token of my appreciation, I created this webpage for you. It’s not fancy or extravagant, as I’m still learning the ropes of coding, but I arranged everything—from the colors to the pictures and videos—just for you. I know you’re not a materialistic person, but I wanted to give you something special. You can visit this webpage anytime, and it won’t get lost like a letter—it’s a digital gift that will always be here, ready for you to revisit whenever you need it. The only reason that I asked your email address was to send you a birthday wish like a pro haha. I hope it brings you some joy, even in a simple form, as a reminder of the special friendship we share.</li>
</ul>

<div>The Beauty of Memory</div>
<ul>
    <li>You may have noticed by now that I take pictures and videos wherever I go. It’s not just because I love technology—it’s because I believe in the power of memory. Every trip, every simple moment, holds a deeper significance. Life moves so quickly, and if we don’t capture it, it can slip away unnoticed. That’s why I cherish every memory, no matter how small, and why I’m always documenting our adventures. One day, these memories will be the stories we share, the ones that remind us of how far we’ve come and all we’ve experienced. I hope you’ll start to see the beauty in preserving moments too, because they are the true treasures of life.</li>
</ul>

<p>Isaiah 40:31 (NIV):
    "But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint."
    This is an encouraging verse, reminding the person that with God, they will have the strength to overcome any challenges.</p>
